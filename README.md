# Open-Source-Community-Project

Our team is building a sovereignty & privacy focused blockchain infrastructure project to provide underserved communities access to the digital economy.  
This project will serve BiPOC (Black, _Indigenous_, People of Color) communities by creating blockchain infrastructure, education content and tooling 
for our people of all ages to experience the power of self-determination.
