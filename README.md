Our team is building a Sovereignty & Privacy focused blockchain infrastructure project to provide underserved communities access to the digital economy.
<p>
This project will serve Indian or BIPoC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) communities by creating blockchain infrastructure, education content and tooling 
for our people of all ages to experience the power of self-determination. </p>
